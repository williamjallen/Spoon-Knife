My current favorite project, Submitty, is organized in a "blessed repository" setup.  Prof. Cutler currently runs the project and is the primary maintainer.  Two former graduate students also have push access to the main branch, but Prof. Cutler remains the primary gatekeeper who ultimately decides to approve or deny potential requests.  For smaller projects I have worked on in the past, the "blessed repository" setup seems to have worked best in general, to make sure at least one person with a solid understanding of the project's overall direction approves each request.  If four or fewer people are working, such as for a class project, a common repository is often a good choice in my experience.  For slightly larger, longer-term, projects, I am personally of the opinion that a blessed repository approach with a small core group of four or fewer "maintainers" is best.  To ensure that all of the maintainers are on the same page at all times, I personally believe that it is best to require approval from two or more maintainers before any given change can be merged.
